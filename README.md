# Variational-Monte-Carlo-Exercises
Here I present three applications of the Variational Monte Carlo Method. 
## Requirements
Please be sure to have installed the following packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot

## Code description
**Exercise_1_harmonic_oscillator**: Given a trial wave function with a parameter alpha, find ground state energy of quantum harmonic oscillator and optimize alpha, using VMC to calculate the energy.
**Exercise_2_harmonic_oscillator_thermalization**: Adding thermalization of VMC calculations on the previous exercise.
**Exercise_3_4He**: Given a trial wave function with three fixed parameters a, beta, gamma, compute the ground state energy of the Helium nucleus using VMC method. Thermalization is also included.
**Exercise_4_4He_optimization**: Given a trial wave function with three free parameters a, beta, gamma, compute the ground state energy of the Helium nucleus and optimize for the best values of a, beta, gamma. VMC is used to compute the energy. Thermalization is also included.
